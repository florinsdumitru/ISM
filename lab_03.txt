0. Synchronization
    execute git pull
    recap inverter from previous lesson
    optional: show what device fingers represent in the layout view in GPDK's case

1. Task: draw custom inverter symbol and prepare inverter testbench
    draw a custom inverter symbol
        automatically generated symbol vs. custom symbol
        Warning: unique schematic pins must match unique symbol pins 1:1!
        selection boxes, demonstrate behavior on pdk transistors
        setting the symbol's origin
    draw inverter testbench schematic
        the importance of 'gnd' (analogLib -> gnd)
        Warning: never attempt to rename/override the ground net's name! (there are consequences)
        using low value resistors or 0 V voltage sources to rename nets
        how do global nets work? (examples: gnd! or vdd!)
        DUT - device under test (lab_02 -> inv)
        no connection symbol - basic -> noConn (used for warning suppression)
        know your multiples (a f p n u m <--> k M G T)
        labeling instances (VSRC_VDD, VSRC_VIN, I_DUT)
        staying on-grid
        test conditions (process = nominal, supply = 3.3 V, temp = 27 deg C, aka PVT)
    configure ADE-XL testbench
        there's an ADE-L hiding in there
        checking for design variables
        setting the analysis
        saving outputs
        Warning: do no run simulations (i.e. press the green button) from ADE-L
        corners, getting the model file path, {NN, FF, SS, SF, FS} explained, bonus: {stat}
        how can we manually netlist & having a look at a netlist
    run testbench {.op} and review results
        simulation output log (and in case of errors, identifying their source)
        results browser
        simulation database structure (dcOp, dc, tran, etc.)
        .op sims are special (since they're only single points, the use of plotting them is limited)
    reviewing results using VIVA - virtuoso visualization and analysis
        cursors (keybindings V and H) vs. markers (keybindings M), marker pairs (M + D)
        CTRL + scroll & SHIFT + scroll for playing with the X & Y axis
        double check your setup -- I_VSRC_VDD = 222 uA, VOUT = 3.047 V
        finally, intentionally interrupting ground
2. Next time:
    running testbenches {.dc .tran .ac}
